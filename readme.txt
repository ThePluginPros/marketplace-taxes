Connect your Dokan or WC Vendors marketplace to TaxJar to automate sales tax calculations, reporting, and filing.

== Description ==

Marketplace Taxes connects your WooCommerce based marketplace to [TaxJar](https://taxjar.com), enabling you to automate sales tax calculations, reporting, and filing so you can focus on running your business.

Whether you want to collect tax on behalf of your merchants or simply make tax collection easier for them, Marketplace Taxes is a great way to make your WooCommerce marketplace more attractive.

== Features ==

= Accurate sales tax calculations =

Calculates sales tax with TaxJar's state-of-the-art [SmartCalcs API](https://www.taxjar.com/smartcalcs/) so you can rest assured that you're collecting the right amount of tax from your marketplace customer, every time. Automatically handles complicated sales tax sourcing rules and accounts for differences in shipping and product taxability between states.

= Optional: Choose to be the seller of record =

In sales tax jargon, the *seller of record* is the person or entity responsible for collecting and remitting sales tax on each sale. With Marketplace Taxes, you can choose to be the seller of record and handle the administrative burden of sales tax for your merchants.

= Simple reporting =

Integrates with [TaxJar Reports](https://www.taxjar.com/sales-tax-reporting/) so you or your sellers can automatically generate accurate, return-ready sales tax reports.

Don't want to use TaxJar Reports? No problem! Just leave the 'Sales tax reporting' option unchecked when configuring the plugin.

= Seller onboarding tools =

When your merchants are the seller of record, they will be guided through configuring their tax settings. Whether you have dozens of merchants or none at all, deploying Marketplace Taxes is easy!

= Affordable pricing =

With TaxJar, you pay a simple monthly fee based on your transaction volume. Pricing starts at only $17/mo for up to 1,000 transactions per month.

= Which TaxJar plan is best for me? =

In order to choose an appropriate TaxJar plan, you need to estimate the number of transactions you'll use each month. To do so:

1. Multiply the average number of orders per month by the average number of sellers per order. This will give you an estimate of your monthly transaction volume.
2. Add the number of orders and refunds you expect to be uploaded to TaxJar each month for reporting.

For example, let's assume your marketplace has an average of 100 orders per month with 2 sellers per order. Let's also assume that you'll be acting as the *seller of record* and uploading orders to TaxJar for reporting. Under these conditions, you can expect to use at least `(100 x 2) + 100 = 300` transactions per month.

Once you know the approximate number of transactions you'll use, you can choose the best [TaxJar plan](https://www.taxjar.com/pricing/plans/) for you.
